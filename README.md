# Moon Phase
A widget for [Ãœbersicht](http://tracesof.net/uebersicht/).  In beta.

![Lit moon](lit-moon.jpg)

Uses the following APIs
* [freegeoip.net](http://freegeoip.net)
  for location based on IP address (if no locale set).

* [Google Geocoding](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)
  for latitude and longitude based on location.

* [US Naval Observatory](http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications)
  for moon phase information based on latitude, longitude, and local time zone.

## Locale and Options
These can be set by editing the `index.coffee` file.

If no locale (city, region) is set, the widget will do a lookup based on your IP.
I recommend saving yourself an API call and setting it: freegeoip doesn't always cooperate.

The font, icon, and colour settings do what you'd expect.
* Fonts are scaled with respect to others to give the widget balance: change at your discretion.
* All text is one colour, the header `Rises, Upper Transit, Sets` can use another.
* All but two data elements -- moon icon and phase name -- can be disabled by setting their option to
`false`.

* Two icon sets can be used: one where pixels represent the `lit` side of the moon, the other where
pixels represent the `shadow` side of the moon.
* There's an additional option (`showAMPM`) to use a 12-hour clock instead of a 24-hour clock.
